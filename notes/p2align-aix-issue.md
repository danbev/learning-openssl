## p2align aix64 issue
This issue was discovered when trying to build (statically) OpenSSL 3.0 with
Node.js. 

### Compile error:
```console
05:39:05 Assembler:
05:39:05 ../deps/openssl/config/archs/aix64-gcc/asm_avx2/crypto/bn/ppc64-mont-fixed.s: line 4: Error In Syntax

This contents of the line and file it is referring to looks like this:
```assembly
.machine        "any"                                                           
.csect  .text[PR],7                                                                
.align  5                                                                          
.p2align        5,,31
```

This assembly source code file is generated as part of the upgrade process
in Node.js.
```console
$ cd deps/openssl/config
$ make aix64-gcc
```
Running this command will configure OpenSSL for `aix64-gcc` and generate the
sources in:
```console
$ ls -l  archs/aix64-gcc/asm_avx2/crypto/bn/
total 52
-rw-rw-r--. 1 danielbevenius danielbevenius 17861 Jun  1 12:08 bn-ppc.s
-rw-rw-r--. 1 danielbevenius danielbevenius  5189 Jun  1 12:08 ppc64-mont-fixed.s
-rw-rw-r--. 1 danielbevenius danielbevenius 23476 Jun  1 12:08 ppc-mont.s
```
`ppc64-mont-fixed.s` is generated by the OpenSSL perl script
`crypto/bn/asm/ppc64-mont-fixed.pl`:
```console

    bn: Add fixed length (n=6), unrolled PPC Montgomery Multiplication
    
    Overall improvement for p384 of ~18% on Power 9, compared to existing
    Power assembling code.  See comment in code for more details.
    
    Multiple unrolled versions could be generated for values other than
    6.  However, for TLS 1.3 the only other ECC algorithms that might use
    Montgomery Multiplication are p256 and p521, but these have custom
    algorithms that don't use Montgomery Multiplication.  Non-ECC
    algorithms are likely to use larger key lengths that won't fit into
    the n <= 10 length limitation of this code.

Notice that this file is quite recent and this might mean that this issue is
not something that we run into before.

On the system in question the GNU Assembler (GAS) is not used, instead the
assembler is 

```assembly
$ cat test.s
.machine        "any"                                                           
.csect  .text[PR],7                                                             
.align  5                                                                       
.p2align        5,,31                                                           
                                                                                
.globl  .bn_mul_mont_fixed_n6                                                   
.bn_mul_mont_fixed_n6:
```

```console
as -v test.s
as V7.2
Assembler:
test.s: line 4: Error In Syntax 
```
We can enable warnings to be reported using `-w`:
```console
as -w -v test.s
as V7.2
Assembler:
test.s: line 3: Warning - The alignment of the current csect is
                less than the alignment specified with the .align pseudo-op.
test.s: line 4: Error In Syntax 
```
